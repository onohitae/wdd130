            <h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my modeling portfolio. I am a Nigerian model and influencer based in the United States; I moved to South Carolina in 2015 and began modeling in college in 2022. I fell in love with modeling from a very young age and am passionate about meeting creatives and bringing their ideas to life. I have worked mainly on commercial and promotional jobs, but I am interested and open to working in other modeling categories. I try to live a healthy lifestyle and spend considerable time working out. I am currently in college and will graduate in December with a B.A. in History, after which I plan to attend law school in either New York, Massachusetts, or Virginia. I am based in Columbia, South Carolina, and I have modeled for local clothing shops in Idaho; however, I can travel to other destinations in the United States.</p>
