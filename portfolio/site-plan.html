      <p>
        Welcome to my modeling portfolio. I am a Nigerian model and influencer based in the United States; I moved to South Carolina in 2015 and began modeling in college in 2022. I fell in love with modeling from a very young age and am passionate about meeting creatives and bringing their ideas to life. I have worked mainly on commercial and promotional jobs, but I am interested and open to working in other modeling categories. I try to live a healthy lifestyle and spend considerable time working out. I am currently in college and will graduate in December with a B.A. in History, after which I plan to attend law school in either New York, Massachusetts, or Virginia. I am based in Columbia, South Carolina, and I have modeled for local clothing shops in Idaho; however, I can travel to other destinations in the United States.

        [POEM]: The Beauty Of A Woman
        The beauty of a woman
        isn't in the clothes she wears,
        The figure that she carries,
        or the way she combs her hair.
        The beauty of a woman
        must be seen from in her eyes;
        Because that's the doorway to her heart,
        the place where love resides.
        The beauty of a woman
        isn't in a facial mole;
        But true beauty in a woman,
        is reflected by her soul.
        It's the caring that she cares to give,
        the passion that she shows;
        And the beauty of a woman
        with passing years only grows.
        Audrey Hepburn
